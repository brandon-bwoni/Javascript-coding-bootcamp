## Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey during the "JavaScript Coding Bootcamp" based on "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. Throughout this bootcamp, I embarked on an enriching journey into the world of JavaScript, building real-world projects to solidify my knowledge and skills. This documentation provides an overview of the course content and the mini projects I successfully completed.

## Course Overview

### JavaScript Fundamentals

- **Description**: The course began with JavaScript fundamentals, covering essential concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures. I gained a strong foundation in the language.

### JavaScript in the Browser: DOM and Events

- **Description**: This module delved into the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling in web development. I learned how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages.

### How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes

- **Description**: Understanding the inner workings of JavaScript, including execution contexts, hoisting, and the call stack, helped me write efficient and bug-free code.

### Data Structures, Modern Operations, and Strings

- **Description**: I explored modern data structures like Sets and Maps, and learned advanced string manipulation techniques. These skills were crucial for processing and managing data.

### In-Depth Functions

- **Description**: Functions are a core concept in JavaScript. I dived deep into function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and higher-order functions. I also grasped closures and the 'this' keyword.

### Arrays in JavaScript

- **Description**: Arrays are a fundamental data structure. I mastered array methods, iteration, and manipulation, making me proficient in handling collections of data.

### Numbers, Dates, Intl, Timers

- **Description**: I delved into working with numbers, dates, and timers in JavaScript. This module covered topics like formatting dates, internationalization (Intl), and creating timers.

### Advanced DOM and Events

- **Description**: Building upon my earlier DOM knowledge, I learned advanced DOM manipulation techniques and event delegation. This was crucial for creating interactive web applications.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript

- **Description**: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a key paradigm in JavaScript. I explored concepts like constructor functions, prototypes, and ES6 classes to build reusable and maintainable code.

### Asynchronous JavaScript

- **Description**: Asynchronous programming is essential for modern web development. I became proficient in handling asynchronous tasks using callbacks, promises, async/await, and the Event Loop.

## Mini Projects

### 1. Number Guessing Game

- **Description**: I created a number guessing game where users guess a random number within a specified range. This project reinforced my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and user interactions.

### 2. Pig Game (Dice Game)

- **Description**: Building a dice game allowed me to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. Players roll dice and accumulate points while avoiding certain outcomes.

### 3. Bankist (Banking App)

- **Description**: Bankist is a banking application that I built during the bootcamp. Users can view account balances, transfer funds, request loans, and more. This project emphasized advanced DOM manipulation and data handling.

### 4. Mapty (Exercise Tracker App)

- **Description**: Mapty is an exercise tracker application where users can log their workouts, view workout statistics, and visualize workout locations on a map. I gained experience in working with maps and geolocation.

### 5. Forkify (Food Recipes App)

- **Description**: Forkify is a food recipes app that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed instructions, and create shopping lists. I honed my skills in working with APIs and implementing search functionality.

## Conclusion

My journey through the "JavaScript Coding Bootcamp" was incredibly enriching. I acquired a deep understanding of JavaScript, ranging from fundamentals to advanced topics. The mini projects served as valuable practical experience, applying the knowledge I gained in real-world scenarios.

I am now well-equipped to tackle complex web development tasks and continue my journey as a proficient JavaScript developer. I look forward to exploring more advanced topics and taking on exciting projects in the world of web development.
